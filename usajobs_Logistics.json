This position MAY be made permanent without further competition contingent upon verification of the incumbent's non-competitive eligibility (must be a 30% veteran, reinstatement eligible, etc., under competitive service). This position may be filled as a Temporary Promotion or a Temporary Reassignment and may be extended for current Department of Army employees.

The authority for personnel demonstration projects (Title 5, United States Code (USC), Part 4703) is the only provision that currently allows the possibility of term conversions.
