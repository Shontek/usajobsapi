DEPLOYABILITY\nDue to the demanding nature of assignments as an Expeditionary Civilian, prospective applicants should carefully assess suitability with respect to medical requirements and other personal/legal issues, including eligibility for a security clearance, job history and experience commensurate with the position description, and ability to handle a job environment with high stress and long (60-70) hours per week. DoD requires that you have the physical &amp; mental capacity, with or without a medical accommodation, to perform the essential functions of a position for a full tour of duty without unreasonable disruption because of health problems. Before you can be deployed, you will be medically screened to determine if you have health conditions that will prevent you from performing assigned duties in theater or that will require a medical waiver to deploy. In most cases medical facilities in Afghanistan and other operational areas where DoD-EC employees are stationed will not be able to accommodate people with serious health problems, psychiatric conditions, or major physical limitations. The physical requirements of the jobs in these operational areas require applicants to be healthy and fit. During your medical evaluation, attending medical personnel will take into account any and all mitigating factors that can influence a decision regarding your deployability. If you are disqualified because of medical or dental issues, you may request a medical waiver. Your qualification for deployment will be based on your medical &amp; dental status at the time of evaluation. If, after your qualification for deployment, you become ill, undergo surgery, add or change medications, undergo therapy/treatment, or develop any condition for which you seek medical assistance, you should notify the DON EC Program Office immediately. You should understand that any significant deterioration in the status of your health may result in your being disqualified from deployment or sent home after you have deployed. Failure to disclose such information may seriously affect your health overseas, as well as undermine the ability of your gaining organization to perform its assigned mission. If you are currently dealing with medical conditions, you may require a waiver after medical evaluation. If you choose to pursue a waiver, you will be required to either 1) demonstrate clearly that you are able to perform the functions of the job to which you are assigned without placing an undue burden on the gaining organization or 2) show that you have been symptom-free for the amount of time indicated below (where appropriate). Waivers are not automatic and may be quite difficult to obtain. Further information may be obtained from MOD 16 to USCENTCOM Individual Protection and Individual/Unit Deployment Policy and PPG-TAB A that accompanies MOD 16, https://media.defense.gov/2022/Mar/09/2002953078/-1/-1/0/USCENTCOM_MOD16.PDF. While an individual's final medical deployment eligibility determination lies with the providers assigned to the National Deployment Center (NDC), the authority to waive certain CENTCOM medical standards rests with the CENTCOM Surgeon's Office.

Interns will be assigned tasks designed to increase familiarity with the target occupation in a real world work environment. Title and pay plan-series-grade at full performance level is Interior Designer GS-1008-11. This opportunity follows a standard promotional path: Internship selection will be made at the GS-04. These grade levels are what typical college students with at least two years (60 semester hours) completed may qualify. Within 120 days after completion of Internship requirements, you may be eligible for conversion to the entry-level for the target occupation. Entry level for these positions are typically at the GS-04 level. The actual grade level at the time of conversion depends on academic achievement and other factors. The full performance level of this position is GS-04. If a student converts to permanent status, they will be put on a new position description with full performance level GS-11. Progression from the entry-level to the full performance level for this occupation will depend on successful completion of all requirements for promotion. Promotions may be considered after a year at each grade level, but are not guaranteed to occur on a specific time schedule. See requirements for conversion to permanent or term position in the \"Additional Information\" section below. To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-04, students must have completed two full academic years of post-high school study or have an associate's degree. Students that will have at least 60 semester hours or equivalent completed by 30 May 2022 are eligible. NOTE: Students that are graduating soon and are not subsequently enrolled in another program might not meet the work-hour requirements prior to graduation and will be at risk for not being able to convert to a career or career-conditional appointment! For qualification purposes, an academic year is computed as follows: At the undergraduate level, successfully completed education that has not led to possession of a degree is credited based on its relationship to 120 semester hours or 180 quarter hours. For example, 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours is comparable to 1 year of undergraduate education. Four years of progressive study or 120 semester hours meets the degree requirements. Additional credit cannot be given for duplicate course work. For study at a business or technical school, 36 weeks of study (20+ classroom hours per week) is comparable to 1 academic year above high school. An academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has determined to represent 1 academic year of full-time study. This determination is made based on normal course loads for a full year of study in the graduate program. If that information cannot be obtained from the school, 18 semester hours or 27 quarter hours should be considered as satisfying the 1 year of full-time study requirement. Part-time graduate education is creditable in accordance with its relationship to a year of full-time study at the school attended. When academic credit is expressed in contract months, units, or other terms that differ from conventional semester or quarter hours, it is the responsibility of the applicant to provide an interpretation of such credits from the appropriate institution in order to equate them to the semester or quarter hours specified in the standard. NOTE: If your college, vocational, trade, technical or high schools' definition of \"academic year\" differs from above, you must submit proof of this difference (e.g., copy of course catalog that defines an academic year). Absent this documentation, you will screened for academic qualifications based on the academic hours as defined in the bullets above.

Short-term training programs (e.g., several two-week programs completed) are not considered an academic course of study. Internship for current students in good standing at an accredited education. For this internship, you may work full-time when not attending classes (i.e. summers, fall and spring breaks, etc.), or part-time. This intern position is designed to prepare a student trainee for employment after graduation as a Public Affairs Specialist. Interns will be assigned tasks designed to increase familiarity with the target occupation in a real world work environment. To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-03, students must have completed one full academic year of post-high school study. To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-04, students must have completed two full academic years of post-high school study or have an associate's degree. For qualification purposes, an academic year is computed as follows: At the undergraduate level, successfully completed education that has not led to possession of a degree is credited based on its relationship to 120 semester hours or 180 quarter hours. For example, 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours is comparable to 1 year of undergraduate education. Four years of progressive study or 120 semester hours meets the degree requirements. Additional credit cannot be given for duplicate course work. For study at a business or technical school, 36 weeks of study (20+ classroom hours per week) is comparable to 1 academic year above high school. An academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has determined to represent 1 academic year of full-time study. This determination is made based on normal course loads for a full year of study in the graduate program. If that information cannot be obtained from the school, 18 semester hours or 27 quarter hours should be considered as satisfying the 1 year of full-time study requirement. Part-time graduate education is creditable in accordance with its relationship to a year of full-time study at the school attended. When academic credit is expressed in contract months, units, or other terms that differ from conventional semester or quarter hours, it is the responsibility of the applicant to provide an interpretation of such credits from the appropriate institution in order to equate them to the semester or quarter hours specified in the standard. NOTE: If your college, vocational, trade, technical or high schools' definition of \"academic year\" differs from above, you must submit proof of this difference (e.g., copy of course catalog that defines an academic year). Absent this documentation, you will screened for academic qualifications based on the academic hours as defined in the bullets above.
