Employees that do not exercise their return rights within five years are no longer eligible for return rights and will be treated as a local hire. This position is eligible for part time, full time or ad-hoc telework at the discretion of management. The DODI 1400.25 V1230 requires that we grant return rights to career and career-conditional DOD employees in the competitive service who are employed in the United States or in a non-foreign area (i.e., Hawaii and Alaska), who accept an assignment in a foreign area or in a non-foreign area different from the one in which they are currently employed.
