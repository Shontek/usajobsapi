They provide the skills that are not readily available in the military, but crucial to support military operations. The Army integrates the talents and skills of its military and civilian members to form a Total Army. The Army values diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, cultures and skills, which connects employees to organizations that are committed to building an inclusive work environment where they can contribute to their fullest potential. This position is located in Manama, Bahrain. Manama is the capital and largest city of Bahrain. Bahrain is a small island country located near the western shores of the Persian Gulf. Saudi Arabia lies to the west and Qatar is to the southeast across the Gulf of Bahrain. The dust storms from Iraq and Saudi Arabia create fine dust particles easily transported by northwesterly winds which cause reduced visibility in the months of June and July. The summer is very hot and dry. Seas around Bahrain are very shallow, heat up quickly in the summer, and produce high humidity, especially at night. Rainfall in Bahrain is minimal and irregular.
