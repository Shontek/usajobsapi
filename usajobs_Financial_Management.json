It is the applicant's responsibility to verify that all information in their resume and documents are legible and accurate. HR will not modify answers/documents submitted by an applicant.","WhatToExpectNext":"When the application process is complete, your complete application (resume, assessment questionnaire, and all supporting documents) will be reviewed to determine if you meet the hiring eligibility and qualification requirements for which you requested consideration. You will be rated based on the information provided in your resume and responses to the questionnaire, along with your supporting documentation to determine your level of knowledge, skill, and ability related to the job requirements. Generally, only best qualified candidates will be referred to the hiring manager. Sometimes well qualified and minimally qualified candidates are referred. Occasionally, candidates eligible for priority consideration are referred, and no other candidates are referred. The hiring manager may choose to conduct interviews. You will be notified of our rating and referral decision. If you are referred, you will be notified when a hiring decision is made. NOTE: Due to COVID19, if you have any questions or need assistance, please email the DON Employment Information Center at DONEIC@us.navy.mil","RequiredDocuments":"You are required to provide documentation that supports the eligibility and qualification claims made in your resume and assessment questionnaire.

SF-50s that have an effective date within the past year (e.g., General Adjustment SF-50 from this year or Within Rate/Grade Increases (WRI/WGI) SF-50 within a year) do not clearly show that you meet the one-year time-in-grade requirement. That means if you submit an SF-50 that is dated within the last year, you must submit another SF-50 that is dated more than one year ago to clearly demonstrate you meet the time-in-grade requirements. If you are a DoD employee, you can obtain a copy of your SF- 50(s) from MyBiz. Are you claiming membership in any professional organizations, or possession of a license, certificate or credentials?

You must submit a copy of your latest DD-214 Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (any copy that shows all dates of service, as well as character of service [Honorable, General, etc.] is acceptable) OR a VA letter that shows dates of service or service connected disability AND character of service. If you have more than one DD-214 for multiple periods of active duty service, submit a copy for each period of service. If you were issued a DD-215 to amend aforementioned information on the DD-214 you must submit that too.

GENERAL INFORMATION: The European Branch Office is located in Wiesbaden, Germany, which is approximately 20 miles from Frankfurt. The climate is noted for mildness, however, there is considerable rainfall in the spring and winter months. Knowledge of the German language is not essential, as English is a second language for many Germans. A non-taxable housing allowance is paid to compensate for housing rental costs, electricity, and heating of the house. Food, clothing, and automobile services may be more expensive on the economy, but are available at reasonable prices at facilities provided by the Army and Air Force Exchange Services (AAFES). These services are offered to military ID holders, which include DCAA employees, and their dependents under 21 years of age, unless that dependent is working here for the military and therefore entitled to their own ID card.

The definition of \"Dependent/Immediate Family\" for civilian employees can be found in the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), Volume 2 (Appendix A, Part I). For a selectee to bring a Non- Dependent to Germany, the Non-Dependent will need to either be granted a Permanent Resident Visa thru the German Consulate or be given Member of Household status through the Garrison in Wiesbaden.
