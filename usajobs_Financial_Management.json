Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies (DKI APCSS) is a U.S. Department of Defense institute that officially opened Sept. 4, 1995, in Honolulu, Hawaii. DKI APCSS addresses regional and global security issues, inviting military and civilian representatives of the United States and Asia-Pacific nations to its comprehensive program of executive education and workshops, both in Hawaii and throughout the Indo-Pacific region. The Center supports the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's objective of developing professional and personal ties among national security establishments throughout the region. With a non-warfighting mission, the Center focuses on a multilateral and multi-dimensional approach to defining and addressing regional security issues and concerns. The most beneficial result is building relationships of trust and confidence among future leaders and decision-makers within the region. DKI APCSS provides a focal point where national officials, decision makers and policy makers can gather to exchange ideas, explore pressing issues and achieve a greater understanding of the challenges that shape the security environment of the Indo-Pacific region. As well, the Center gives attention to the increasingly complex interrelationships of military, economic, political and diplomatic policies relevant to regional security issues through its three academic components: executive education, workshops and research and publications efforts.","TravelCode":"1","ApplyOnlineUrl":"https://apply.usastaffing.gov/Application/Apply","DetailStatusUrl":"https://apply.usastaffing.gov/Application/ApplicationStatus","MajorDuties":["You will plan, organize, and carry out annual multi-year budgeting projects.","You will be responsible for planning, directing, reviewing, managing and controlling of the budget planning, execution, evaluation and financial management functions.","You will establish work methods and procedures that will ensure the preparation of all budget execution actions.","You will make recommendations relative to redistribution of funding in response to changes in budgetary guidance and staffing levels.","You will advise and assist managers in preparing, documenting, and submitting detailed budget estimates.","You will provide interpretation, advice and recommendations, which affect the management control and consistency of program planning, evaluation and financial management.","You will respond to queries from project managers, Contracting Officer Representatives, private contractors, and others relative to problems and questions involving contracts.","You will provide technical leadership, coordinate problem resolution, and ensure internal/external reporting requirements are satisfied in a timely and professional manner."],"Education":"","Requirements":"","Evaluations":"In order to qualify for this position, your resume must provide sufficient experience and/or education, knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform the duties of the specific position for which you are being considered.

Short-term training programs (e.g., several two-week programs completed) are not considered an academic course of study. Internship for current students in good standing at an accredited education. For this internship, you must be able to work at least part-time 24 hours during the school year and possibly full-time during the Summer, school breaks, or throughout the school year. This intern position is designed to prepare a student trainee for employment after graduation as an Accountant, Budget Analyst, or Program/Management Analyst. Interns will be assigned tasks designed to increase familiarity with the target occupation in a real world work environment. This opportunity follows a standard promotional path: Internship selection will be made at the GS-04. A student qualifies for the GS-4 level if they've completed 2 full academic years of post-high school stud or have an associate's degree, or will have completed 2 full academic years of post-high school study or have an associate's degree by May 31, 2022. Within 120 days after completion of Internship requirements, you may be eligible for conversion to the entry-level for the target occupation. Entry level for these positions are typically at the GS-05 or GS-07 level. The actual grade level at the time of conversion depends on academic achievement and other factors. The full performance level of this position is GS-09 or GS-11. Progression from the entry-level to the full performance level for this occupation will depend on successful completion of all requirements for promotion. Promotions may be considered after a year at each grade level, but are not guaranteed to occur on a specific time schedule. See requirements for conversion to permanent or term position in the \"Additional Information\" section below. To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-04, students must have completed two full academic years of post-high school study or have an associate's degree. For qualification purposes, an academic year is computed as follows: At the undergraduate level, successfully completed education that has not led to possession of a degree is credited based on its relationship to 120 semester hours or 180 quarter hours. For example, 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours is comparable to 1 year of undergraduate education. Four years of progressive study or 120 semester hours meets the degree requirements. Additional credit cannot be given for duplicate course work. For study at a business or technical school, 36 weeks of study (20+ classroom hours per week) is comparable to 1 academic year above high school. An academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has determined to represent 1 academic year of full-time study. This determination is made based on normal course loads for a full year of study in the graduate program. If that information cannot be obtained from the school, 18 semester hours or 27 quarter hours should be considered as satisfying the 1 year of full-time study requirement. Part-time graduate education is creditable in accordance with its relationship to a year of full-time study at the school attended. When academic credit is expressed in contract months, units, or other terms that differ from conventional semester or quarter hours, it is the responsibility of the applicant to provide an interpretation of such credits from the appropriate institution in order to equate them to the semester or quarter hours specified in the standard. NOTE: Students that are graduating in May 2022, and are not subsequently enrolled in another program will not be eligible for this Student Internship opportunity. Students must provide proof of current student status. Students that are graduating within the next few months might not meet the work-hour requirements prior to graduation and will be at risk for not being able to convert to a career or career-conditional appointment! NOTE: If your college, vocational, trade, technical or high schools' definition of \"academic year\" differs from above, you must submit proof of this difference (e.g., copy of course catalog that defines an academic year).
