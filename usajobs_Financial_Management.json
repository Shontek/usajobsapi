It is a time limited position and may be extended up to a maximum of eight years total. This position may be converted to a permanent, career or career-conditional appointment without further competition as long as all requirements are met. To be eligible for conversion, employee must complete at least 2 years of current continuous service under a term appointment in the competitive service AND employee must have a current performance rating under such term appointment of at least fully successful or equivalent. This position MAY be made permanent without further competition contingent upon verification of the incumbent's non-competitive eligibility (must be a 30% veteran, reinstatement eligible, etc., under competitive service). NOTE: Under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA) selectees must be given a career or career conditional appointment; therefore, VEOA eligible veterans are not eligible to apply to this announcement unless you also have another type of status such as 30% or more disabled veteran. This position may be filled as a Temporary Promotion or a Temporary Reassignment and may be extended for current Department of Army employees. At the end of this period, you will return to your permanent position of record, or to a different position of equivalent grade and pay. This is a TERM position. Although term employees often are hired following the same competitive procedures that are used for hiring permanent employees, term employees do not have status in the competitive service. Consequently, unless they attained status through an earlier appointment, they cannot be selected from their term appointment for permanent career or career conditional appointments through internal merit promotion procedures. Such conversions cannot occur without special legal authority. The authority for personnel demonstration projects (Title 5, United States Code (USC), Part 4703) is the only provision that currently allows the possibility of term conversions.

These allowances are computed on Department of State guidelines and are subject to change. Current Cost of Living Allowance is at a 25% index which is applied to the expendable income determined based on gross base salary.

GENERAL INFORMATION: The European Branch Office is located in Wiesbaden, Germany, which is approximately 20 miles from Frankfurt. The climate is noted for mildness, however, there is considerable rainfall in the spring and winter months. Knowledge of the German language is not essential, as English is a second language for many Germans. A non-taxable housing allowance is paid to compensate for housing rental costs, electricity, and heating of the house. Food, clothing, and automobile services may be more expensive on the economy, but are available at reasonable prices at facilities provided by the Army and Air Force Exchange Services (AAFES). These services are offered to military ID holders, which include DCAA employees, and their dependents under 21 years of age, unless that dependent is working here for the military and therefore entitled to their own ID card. Applicants should be aware that jobs for dependents, especially professional positions, can be difficult but not necessarily impossible to obtain. The definition of \"Dependent/Immediate Family\" for civilian employees can be found in the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), Volume 2 (Appendix A, Part I). For a selectee to bring a Non- Dependent to Germany, the Non-Dependent will need to either be granted a Permanent Resident Visa thru the German Consulate or be given Member of Household status through the Garrison in Wiesbaden. These processes must be approved before relocating to Germany as they are both difficult to obtain. Applicants are responsible for obtaining relevant information regarding the qualification and application process for Resident Visa and Member of Household. Non-dependent members of the family do not have the same privileges as dependents on employee's PCS order. Public transportation in Europe, and particularly in Germany, is abundant, timely, and comfortable. Wiesbaden is centrally located and offers vacation travel opportunities for auditors and their dependents assigned to the FAO. In addition, there are a few U.S. Government owned hotels available in Europe through the Armed Forces Recreation Centers. Government hotels offer reasonable priced rates to DOD travelers. Restaurants and other eating places are abundant in Europe. Shipment of ONE privately owned vehicle at Government expense is authorized, subject to prior approval. MEDICAL FACILITIES: Medical services are offered at military installations in the surrounding areas on a limited basis. The closest military hospital is approximately a one-hour drive from Wiesbaden. OTHER ITEMS: Pets are welcomed in Germany and is not uncommon to see them with their owners in local restaurants. The costs associated with brining a pet overseas including the added hotel costs incurred when housing a pet in your temporary quarters are not reimbursable.","PositionRemuneration":[{"MinimumRange":"81216.0","MaximumRange":"105579.0","RateIntervalCode":"Per Year"}],"PositionStartDate":"2022-06-28T10:17:29.6970","PositionEndDate":"2022-07-13T23:59:59.9970","PublicationStartDate":"2022-06-28T10:17:29.6970","ApplicationCloseDate":"2022-07-13T23:59:59.9970","PositionFormattedDescription":[{"Label":"Dynamic Teaser","LabelDescription":"Hit highlighting for keyword searches."}],"UserArea":{"Details":{"JobSummary":"Reemployed annuitant: This vacancy does not meet the criteria for appointment of annuitants.","WhoMayApply":{"Name":"","Code":""},"LowGrade":"13","HighGrade":"13","PromotionPotential":"None","SubAgencyName":"DCAA - EASTERN REGION","OrganizationCodes":"DD/DD10","Relocation":"True","HiringPath":["fed-internal-search"],"AgencyMarketingStatement":"Are you looking for a leadership opportunity in a progressive organization dedicated to continuous improvement?
