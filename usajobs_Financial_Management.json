Human Resources will determine your qualifications for each entry grade level based on your interest and the additional following criteria. Resumes for federal government positions need more detailed work descriptions and accomplishments than a typical private sector resume. Please be sure to clearly describe this in your resume. One year of specialized experience equivalent in level of difficulty and responsibility to that of a GS-11 within the federal service, which demonstrates the ability to perform the duties of the position, is required: Specialized experience is defined as: performing data analysis and evaluation of financial systems, policies, procedures, and regulations to ensure the continuity of a financial organization's business operations; compiling financial data from various sources and ensuring their accuracy as it pertains to financial legislation and operational policies and procedures; providing management recommendations on corrective action plans to address issues found in financial systems or program. Education is not substitutable for specialized experience at this grade level. Volunteer Experience: Experience refers to paid and unpaid experience, including volunteer work done through National Service programs (e.g., Peace Corps, AmeriCorps) and other organizations (e.g., professional; philanthropic; religious; spiritual, community, student, social). Volunteer work helps build critical competencies, knowledge, and skills and can provide valuable training and experience that translates to paid employment. You will receive credit for all qualifying experience, including volunteer experience.","PositionRemuneration":[{"MinimumRange":"80087.0","MaximumRange":"104117.0","RateIntervalCode":"Per Year"}],"PositionStartDate":"2022-01-03T08:44:08.8470","PositionEndDate":"2022-01-14T23:59:59.9970","PublicationStartDate":"2022-01-03T08:44:08.8470","ApplicationCloseDate":"2022-01-14T23:59:59.9970","PositionFormattedDescription":[{"Label":"Dynamic Teaser","LabelDescription":"Hit highlighting for keyword searches."}],"UserArea":{"Details":{"JobSummary":"Who may apply: United States Citizens Pay for first time hires to the Federal Government will typically be set at step 1 salary range for their respective grade level.","WhoMayApply":{"Name":"","Code":""},"LowGrade":"12","HighGrade":"12","PromotionPotential":"12","SubAgencyName":"DFAS - EXPEDITIONARY SUPPORT ORGANIZATION","OrganizationCodes":"DD/DD35","Relocation":"False","HiringPath":["public"],"TotalOpenings":"1","AgencyMarketingStatement":"DFAS' (Defense Finance and Accounting Service) mission is to lead the DoD (Department of Defense) in finance and accounting by ensuring the delivery of efficient, exceptional quality pay and financial information.
