An academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has determined to represent 1 academic year of full-time study. This determination is made based on normal course loads for a full year of study in the graduate program.

Short-term training programs (e.g., several two-week programs completed) are not considered an academic course of study. Internship for current students in good standing at an accredited education. For this internship, you must be able to work part-time, up to 20 hours per week, when school is in session and full-time when not attending classes. This intern position is designed to prepare a student trainee for employment after graduation as an Administrative Support Assistant (OA). Interns will be assigned tasks designed to increase familiarity with the target occupation in a real world work environment. This opportunity follows a standard promotional path: Internship selection will be made at the GS-02, GS-03, or GS-04 grade level. These grade levels are what typical college students in their first, second, or third year may qualify for. Internship target grade is GS-04. Within 120 days after completion of Internship requirements, you may be eligible for conversion to the entry-level for the target occupation. Entry level for these positions are typically at the GS-04 or GS-05 grade level. The actual grade level at the time of conversion depends on academic achievement and other factors, including management discretion. The full performance level of this position may be GS-05 or GS-06, depending on management discretion. Progression from the entry-level to the full performance level for this occupation will depend on successful completion of all requirements for promotion. Promotions may be considered after a year at each grade level, but are not guaranteed to occur on a specific time schedule. See requirements for conversion to permanent or term position in the \"Additional Information\" section below. To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-02, students must have completed high school or a GED diploma. To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-03, students must have completed one full academic year of post-high school study. To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-04, students must have completed two full academic years of post-high school study or have an associate's degree. For qualification purposes, an academic year is computed as follows: At the undergraduate level, successfully completed education that has not led to possession of a degree is credited based on its relationship to 120 semester hours or 180 quarter hours. For example, 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours is comparable to 1 year of undergraduate education. Four years of progressive study or 120 semester hours meets the degree requirements. Additional credit cannot be given for duplicate course work. For study at a business or technical school, 36 weeks of study (20+ classroom hours per week) is comparable to 1 academic year above high school. An academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has determined to represent 1 academic year of full-time study. This determination is made based on normal course loads for a full year of study in the graduate program. If that information cannot be obtained from the school, 18 semester hours or 27 quarter hours should be considered as satisfying the 1 year of full-time study requirement. Part-time graduate education is creditable in accordance with its relationship to a year of full-time study at the school attended.
