Additional information about transcripts is in this document. Basic Requirement for Diagnostic Radiologic Technologist (Magnetic Resonance Imaging): Radiology Certification: Public Law 97-35 requires that persons who administer radiologic procedures meet the credentialing standards in 42 CFR Part 75. Essentially, they must (1) have successfully completed an educational program that meets or exceeds the standards described in that regulation, and is accredited by an organization recognized by the Department of Education, and (2) be certified as radiographers in their field. (Note: You must attach a copy of your certification.) The following meet these requirements: (1) Persons employed by the Federal Government as radiologic personnel prior to the effective date of the regulation (January 13, 1986) who show evidence of current or fully satisfactory performance or certification of such from a licensed practitioner such as a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, podiatry, or chiropractic who prescribes radiologic procedures to others. (2) Persons first employed by the Federal Government as radiologic personnel after the effective date of the regulation who (a) received training from institutions in a State or foreign jurisdiction that did not accredit training in that particular field at the time of graduation, or (b) practiced in a State or foreign jurisdiction that did not license that particular field or did not allow special eligibility to take a licensure examination for those who did not graduate from an accredited educational program, provided such persons show evidence of training, experience, and competence, as determined by OPM or the employing agency.

OR Education: Master's or equivalent graduate degree, or 2 full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree in a field directly related to the work of the position, such as Diagnostic Radiology or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Radiology. OR Combination of Education and Experience: A combination of education and experience may be used to qualify for this position as long as the computed percentage of the requirement is at least 100%. To compute the percentage of the requirements, divide your total months of qualifying experience by 12. Then divide the total number of completed graduate semester hours (or equivalent) beyond the first year (total graduate semester hours minus 18) by 18.

OR Education: Master's or equivalent graduate degree, or 2 full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree in a field directly related to the work of the position, such as Diagnostic Radiology or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Radiology. OR Combination of Education and Experience: A combination of education and experience may be used to qualify for this position as long as the computed percentage of the requirement is at least 100%. To compute the percentage of the requirements, divide your total months of qualifying experience by 12. Then divide the total number of completed graduate semester hours (or equivalent) beyond the first year (total graduate semester hours minus 18) by 18.
