The following meet these requirements:\n(1) Persons employed by the Federal Government as radiologic personnel prior to the effective date of the regulation (January 13, 1986) who show evidence of current or fully satisfactory performance or certification of such from a licensed practitioner such as a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, podiatry, or chiropractic who prescribes radiologic procedures to others.\n(2) Persons first employed by the Federal Government as radiologic personnel after the effective date of the regulation who (a) received training from institutions in a State or foreign jurisdiction that did not accredit training in that particular field at the time of graduation, or (b) practiced in a State or foreign jurisdiction that did not license that particular field or did not allow special eligibility to take a licensure examination for those who did not graduate from an accredited educational program, provided such persons show evidence of training, experience, and competence, as determined by OPM or the employing agency.\nSpecialized experience: One year of specialized experience which includes performing radiologic examinations and setting up the x-ray room or preparing or administering contrast material. This definition of specialized experience is typical of work performed at the next lower grade/level position in the federal service (GS-06). Some federal jobs allow you to substitute your education for the required experience in order to qualify. For this job, you may qualify if your education meets the definitions below: Education Substitution for Specialized Experience for GS-07: One full year of graduate level education in a field directly related to the work of the position, such as Diagnostic Radiology/Radiography. OR Combination of Experience and Education Substitution for Specialized Experience for GS-07: A combination of education and experience may be used to qualify for this position as long as the computed percentage of the requirements is at least 100%. To compute the percentage of the requirements, divide your total months of experience by 12. Then divide the total number of completed graduate semester hours (or equivalent) by 18. Add the two percentages.","PositionRemuneration":[{"MinimumRange":"44740.0","MaximumRange":"58158.0","RateIntervalCode":"Per Year"}],"PositionStartDate":"2022-07-01T00:00:00.0000","PositionEndDate":"2022-07-12T23:59:59.9970","PublicationStartDate":"2022-07-01T00:00:00.0000","ApplicationCloseDate":"2022-07-12T23:59:59.9970","PositionFormattedDescription":[{"Label":"Dynamic Teaser","LabelDescription":"Hit highlighting for keyword searches."}],"UserArea":{"Details":{"JobSummary":"This is a Direct Hire Authority (DHA) solicitation utilizing the DHA for Certain Personnel of the DoD Workforce to recruit and appoint qualified candidates to positions in the competitive service.

Tax Law Impact for PCS: On 22-Dec-2017, Public Law 115-97 - the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\" suspended qualified moving expense deductions along with the exclusion for employer reimbursements and payments of moving expenses effective 01-Jan-2018 for tax years 2018 through 2025. The law made taxable certain reimbursements and other payments, including driving mileage, airfare and lodging expenses, en-route travel to the new duty station, and temporary storage of those items. The Federal Travel Regulation Bulletin (FTR) 18-05 issued by General Services Administration (GSA) has authorized agencies to use the Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA) and Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA) to pay for \"substantially all\" of the increased tax liability resulting from the \"2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" for certain eligible individuals. For additional information on WTA/RITA allowances and eligibilities please click here.
