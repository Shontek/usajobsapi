Short-term training programs (e.g., several two-week programs completed) are not considered an academic course of study.\nInternship for current students in good standing at an accredited education. For this internship, you must be able to work in one of the physical locations advertised while attending/enrolled in school. When not attending classes you are required to work (i.e. summers, fall and spring breaks, etc.). This intern position is designed to prepare a student trainee for employment after graduation as a Maintenance Mechanic. Interns will be assigned tasks designed to increase familiarity with the target occupation in a real world work environment. This opportunity follows a standard promotional path: Internship selection will be made at the WG-03. These grade levels are what typical college students in their may qualify. Within 120 days after completion of Internship requirements, you may be eligible for conversion to the entry-level for the target occupation. Entry level for these positions are typically at the WG-08 level. The actual grade level at the time of conversion depends on academic achievement and other factors. The full performance level of this position is WG-10. Progression from the entry-level to the full performance level for this occupation will depend on successful completion of all requirements for promotion. Promotions may be considered after a year at each grade level, but are not guaranteed to occur on a specific time schedule. See requirements for conversion to permanent or term position in the \"Additional Information\" section below. For qualification purposes, an academic year is computed as follows: At the undergraduate level, successfully completed education that has not led to possession of a degree is credited based on its relationship to 120 semester hours or 180 quarter hours. For example, 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours is comparable to 1 year of undergraduate education. Four years of progressive study or 120 semester hours meets the degree requirements. Additional credit cannot be given for duplicate course work. For study at a business or technical school, 36 weeks of study (20+ classroom hours per week) is comparable to 1 academic year above high school. An academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has determined to represent 1 academic year of full-time study. This determination is made based on normal course loads for a full year of study in the graduate program. If that information cannot be obtained from the school, 18 semester hours or 27 quarter hours should be considered as satisfying the 1 year of full-time study requirement. Part-time graduate education is creditable in accordance with its relationship to a year of full-time study at the school attended. When academic credit is expressed in contract months, units, or other terms that differ from conventional semester or quarter hours, it is the responsibility of the applicant to provide an interpretation of such credits from the appropriate institution in order to equate them to the semester or quarter hours specified in the standard. NOTE: If your college, vocational, trade, technical or high schools' definition of \"academic year\" differs from above, you must submit proof of this difference (e.g., copy of course catalog that defines an academic year). Absent this documentation, you will screened for academic qualifications based on the academic hours as defined in the bullets above.

The incumbent may be required to take part in readiness exercises. This position cannot be vacated during a national emergency or mobilization without seriously impairing the capability of the organization to function effectively; therefore, the position requires the incumbent to be screened from military recall. Military Reservists selected for an EC position must arrange for a military deployment waiver from the Secretary Service level or transfer to the IRR Standby Reserve prior to appointment to an EC position. The waiver or transfer will remain in effect while assigned to the EC position. This requirement must be met prior to placement in an EC position.

Deployment may entitle the employee to additional monetary compensation dependent upon the deployment location. Additional allocations are based on the Department of State's determination of a combat zone. Physical Effort:\nThe incumbent exerts moderate physical effort because the large vehicles driven and accompanying heavy loads are difficult to handle and maneuver, e.g., upper body strength must be used to turn the steering wheel. Numerous hand and foot controls are often used simultaneously, e.g., clutch, accelerator, gearshift, and levers. Dual braking systems must be manipulated to avoid jackknifing. Since vehicles operated are large, the cab is often located considerably above ground level; therefore, some effort is required when entering and existing the vehicle. Bending, reaching, lifting, pulling, stooping, and exertion of physical effort is involved when attaching/detaching trailers and securing cargo. Performs work on hard surfaces and in work areas that require standing, stooping, bending and working in tiring and uncomfortable positions. Frequently lifts and carries items weighing up to 70 lbs. Moderate physical effort is used in operating hand and foot controls when operating materials handling equipment. Working Conditions:\nThe incumbent typically operates a vehicle while sitting behind a steering wheel in an enclosed or covered cab. Vehicles operated may or may not be equipped with a heater and/or air conditioning. Occasionally, the incumbent will work outdoors or in an enclosed structure, e.g., when performing safety inspections, making minor emergency repairs; observing the loading/unloading of cargo, filling fluid levels, etc. Vehicles are operated in all types of prevailing weather conditions and (1) in congested areas of a supply depot/center where there is frequent vehicle, materials handling, equipment, rail, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic; and/or (2) in traffic and at highway speeds on public roadways during the day or night. There is exposure to dirt, grease, fumes, and noise. There is the possibility of life-threatening accidents, cuts, bruises, abrasions, and broken bones.
