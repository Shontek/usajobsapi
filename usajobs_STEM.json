Basic Requirement: Degree: in operations research; or at least 24 semester hours in a combination of operations research, mathematics, probability, statistics, mathematical logic, science, or subject-matter courses requiring substantial competence in college-level mathematics or statistics. At least 3 of the 24 semester hours must have been in calculus. Evaluation of Education:\nThe primary requirement of operations research work is competence in the rigorous methods of scientific inquiry and analysis rather than in the subject matter of the problem. Therefore, applicants should have sufficient knowledge of applied mathematics to understand and use the fundamental concepts and techniques of operations research methods of analysis. In addition, some positions may require knowledge of a specific subject area.\nCourses acceptable for qualifying for operations research positions may have been taken in departments other than Operations Research, e.g., Engineering (usually Industrial Engineering), Science, Economics, Mathematics, Statistics, or Management Science.\nThe following are illustrative of acceptable courses: optimization; mathematical modeling; queueing theory; engineering; physics (except descriptive or survey courses); econometrics; psychometrics; biometrics; experimental psychology; physical chemistry; industrial process analysis; managerial economics; computer science; measurement for management; mathematical models in social phenomena; and courses that involved application of operations research techniques and methodologies to problems of management, marketing, systems design, and other specialized fields; or other comparable quantitative analysis courses for which college-level mathematics or statistics is a prerequisite. Courses in theory of probability and statistics are highly desirable, but are not specified as minimum educational requirements because to do so would possibly exclude some applicants who would otherwise be well qualified. To qualify for an Interdisciplinary (08XX), your resume and supporting documentation must support: A. Basic Requirement: A Bachelor's Degree or higher in professional engineering. To be acceptable, the program must: (1) be in a school of engineering with at least one program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) as a professional engineering curriculum; or (2) include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics. OR A combination of education and experience -- college-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the physical and mathematical sciences underlying professional engineering, and (2) a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the engineering sciences and techniques and their applications to one of the branches of engineering. The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following: A. Professional Registration or Licensure -- Current registration as an Engineer Intern (EI), Engineer in Training (EIT), or licensure as a Professional Engineer (PE) by any State, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions. B. Written Test -- Evidence of having successfully passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination or any other written test required for professional registration by an engineering licensure board in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. C. Specified academic courses -- Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and in engineering that included the courses specified in the Basic Requirements above. The courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of a professional engineering curriculum as described in the Basic Requirements above. D. Related curriculum -- Successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in an appropriate scientific field, e.g. engineering technology physics, chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology, may be accepted in lieu of a bachelor's degree in engineering, provided the applicant has had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. Ordinarily there should be either an established plan of intensive training to develop professional engineering competence, or several years of prior professional engineering-type experience, e.g., in interdisciplinary positions. Specialized Experience: Must possess one year of specialized experience at the GS-11 grade level or equivalent under other pay systems in the Federal service, military or private sector. Examples of creditable specialized experience includes: Conducting Earned Value Management compliance reviews. Assisting in the development of cost, mathematical, statistical and automated data systems design models for evaluation. Collecting data to asses projected capabilities of mission support.","PositionRemuneration":[{"MinimumRange":"83523.0","MaximumRange":"108584.0","RateIntervalCode":"Per Year"}],"PositionStartDate":"2021-10-25T12:50:58.0700","PositionEndDate":"2021-11-08T23:59:59.9970","PublicationStartDate":"2021-10-25T12:50:58.0700","ApplicationCloseDate":"2021-11-08T23:59:59.9970","PositionFormattedDescription":[{"Label":"Dynamic Teaser","LabelDescription":"Hit highlighting for keyword searches."}],"UserArea":{"Details":{"JobSummary":"See below for important information regarding this job.

DoD requires that you have the physical & mental capacity, with or without a medical accommodation, to perform the essential functions of a position for a full tour of duty without unreasonable disruption because of health problems. Before you can be deployed, you will be medically screened to determine if you have health conditions that will prevent you from performing assigned duties in theater or that will require a medical waiver to deploy. In most cases medical facilities in Afghanistan and other operational areas where DoD-EC employees are stationed will not be able to accommodate people with serious health problems, psychiatric conditions, or major physical limitations. The physical requirements of the jobs in these operational areas require applicants to be healthy and fit. During your medical evaluation, attending medical personnel will take into account any and all mitigating factors that can influence a decision regarding your deployability. If you are disqualified because of medical or dental issues, you may request a medical waiver. Additional vacancies may be filled by this announcement. This is an unaccompanied tour. A deployment offer will be rescinded if the selectee fails to meet the pre-employment requirements. While deployed with the DoD-EC Workforce in a TDY status, you are eligible to continue your current Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) coverage, but deployment creates a \"qualifying life event\" for purposes of FEHB if you are covered by a FEHB Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) since you will be outside of the geographic area from which the FEHB carrier accepts enrollments or provides coverage. You may contact the Government Retirement & Benefits (GRB) Platform for further information. The link for GRB contact information is https://mypers.af.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/5785/kw/SF%202823/p/2/p/2 When deployed with the DoD-EC Workforce in a TDY status, you are eligible to continue your current Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Coverage (FEGLI); deployment does not cancel FEGLI coverage. Additionally, if you deploy in support of a contingency operation and if as a civilian employee you have previously waived some or all FEGLI coverage, you may elect the following FEGLI coverage outside an open season, without experiencing a qualifying life event, and without providing medical information: Basic coverage; and if you already have or elect Basic, you may also may elect Option A (Standard) coverage, and/or Option B (Additional) coverage. To elect/increase your FEGLI coverage once you receive your official offer letter, you may call the Benefits line at 1-888-320-2917, option 4. All eligible employees may participate in the Thrift Savings Plan while deployed. There is NO entitlement to temporary storage of household goods while deployed in a TDY status.

The curriculum for a degree in either architecture or architectural engineering covers function, esthetics, site, structure, economics, mechanical-electrical, and other engineering problems related to the design and construction of buildings primarily (but not exclusively) intended to house human activities. The courses required for a degree in architecture generally place emphasis upon planning, esthetics, and materials and methods of construction, while the courses for an architectural engineering degree place equal or greater weight on the technical engineering aspects such as structural systems, mechanical systems, and the properties of materials. Because of this difference in emphasis, persons with degrees in architecture may have a preference for work assignments that offer greater opportunities for them to express their artistic and creative abilities. As a result, they may be more concerned with planning and design aspects of architecture, and persons with degrees in architectural engineering may be more engaged in aspects emphasizing technical engineering considerations.
