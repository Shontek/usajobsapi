Applicants must meet eligibility requirements including time-in-grade (General Schedule (GS) positions only), time-after-competitive appointment, minimum qualifications, and any other regulatory requirements by the cut-off/closing date of the announcement.

Education Substitution: Such education must demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to do the work.

To qualify based on education in lieu of specialized experience, you must possess: 3 full academic years of progressively higher-level graduate education, Ph.D., or equivalent doctoral degree.\nC. Combination: Combinations of successfully completed post-high school education and experience may be used to meet total qualifications and may be computed by first determining the applicant's total qualifying experience as a percentage of the experience required for the grade level; then determining the applicant's education as a percentage of the education required for the grade level; and then adding the two percentages.
