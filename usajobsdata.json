DoD requires that you have the physical & mental capacity, with or without a medical accommodation, to perform the essential functions of a position for a full tour of duty without unreasonable disruption because of health problems. Before you can be deployed, you will be medically screened to determine if you have health conditions that will prevent you from performing assigned duties in theater or that will require a medical waiver to deploy. In most cases medical facilities in Afghanistan and other operational areas where DoD-EC employees are stationed will not be able to accommodate people with serious health problems, psychiatric conditions, or major physical limitations. The physical requirements of the jobs in these operational areas require applicants to be healthy and fit. During your medical evaluation, attending medical personnel will take into account any and all mitigating factors that can influence a decision regarding your deployability. If you are disqualified because of medical or dental issues, you may request a medical waiver. Additional vacancies may be filled by this announcement. This is an unaccompanied tour. A deployment offer will be rescinded if the selectee fails to meet the pre-employment requirements. While deployed with the DoD-EC Workforce in a TDY status, you are eligible to continue your current Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) coverage, but deployment creates a \"qualifying life event\" for purposes of FEHB if you are covered by a FEHB Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) since you will be outside of the geographic area from which the FEHB carrier accepts enrollments or provides coverage. You may contact the Government Retirement & Benefits (GRB) Platform for further information. The link for GRB contact information is https://mypers.af.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/5785/kw/SF%202823/p/2/p/2 When deployed with the DoD-EC Workforce in a TDY status, you are eligible to continue your current Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Coverage (FEGLI); deployment does not cancel FEGLI coverage. Additionally, if you deploy in support of a contingency operation and if as a civilian employee you have previously waived some or all FEGLI coverage, you may elect the following FEGLI coverage outside an open season, without experiencing a qualifying life event, and without providing medical information: Basic coverage; and if you already have or elect Basic, you may also may elect Option A (Standard) coverage, and/or Option B (Additional) coverage. To elect/increase your FEGLI coverage once you receive your official offer letter, you may call the Benefits line at 1-888-320-2917, option 4.
