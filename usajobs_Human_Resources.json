As of 23 December 2016, Military retirees seeking to enter federal service in the Department of Defense now require a waiver if they would be appointed within 180 days following their official date of retirement. DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE: The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has established a Drug-Free Federal Workplace Policy. All applicants tentatively selected for DLA employment in a testing designated position are subject to urinalysis to screen for illegal drug use prior to appointment. Applicants who refuse to be tested will be denied employment with DLA for a period of six months. This policy extends to random testing for the use of illegal drugs by employees who occupy testing designated positions defined as sensitive in Section 7(d) of Executive Order 12564. The Defense Logistics Agency's Drug Free Workplace Plan's drug testing panel includes testing for the following illegal substances: marijuana, cocaine, opiates (codeine/morphine), 6-Acetylmorphine (heroin), phencyclidine, amphetamines (amphetamine/methamphetamine), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone. ADVISORY: By using cannabidiol (CBD) products you are risking a positive drug test result for marijuana.","KeyRequirements":[],"WithinArea":"False","CommuteDistance":"0","ServiceType":"01","AnnouncementClosingType":"01","AgencyContactEmail":"DHRC-HQ@dla.mil","AgencyContactPhone":"614-692-0323","SecurityClearance":"Other","DrugTestRequired":"False","AdjudicationType":[],"TeleworkEligible":true,"RemoteIndicator":false},"IsRadialSearch":false}},"RelevanceRank":0},{"MatchedObjectId":"660921800","MatchedObjectDescriptor":{"PositionID":"ST-11532345-22-JW","PositionTitle":"HUMAN RESOURCES SPECIALIST (ER/LR)","PositionURI":"https://www.usajobs.gov:443/GetJob/ViewDetails/660921800","ApplyURI":["https://www.usajobs.gov:443/GetJob/ViewDetails/660921800?PostingChannelID="],"PositionLocationDisplay":"Naval Air Station San Diego, California","PositionLocation":[{"LocationName":"Naval Air Station San Diego, California","CountryCode":"United States","CountrySubDivisionCode":"California","CityName":"Naval Air Station San Diego, California","Longitude":-117.18256,"Latitude":32.7267}],"OrganizationName":"Naval Air Systems Command","DepartmentName":"Department of the Navy","JobCategory":[{"Name":"Human Resources Management","Code":"0201"}],"JobGrade":[{"Code":"GS"}],"PositionSchedule":[{"Name":"Full-time","Code":"1"}],"PositionOfferingType":[{"Name":"Permanent","Code":"15317"}],"QualificationSummary":"GS-12: Your resume must demonstrate at least one year of specialized experience at or equivalent to the GS-11 grade level or pay band in the Federal service or equivalent experience in the private or public sector.
